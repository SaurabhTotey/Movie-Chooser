## TODO

- Finish statistics page
- Ensure handling of IDs of 0 is consistent for both users and movies
- Allow names to be changed and change the name of the Form component to something like AccountForm
- See how much of the website can be migrated to use tables in place of CollapsibleSections of MovieCards (lots of room for improvement in the statistics page)
- Documentation of EVERYTHING
- This README
- License
- Styling -- especially a better look for watching movies at night (so basically a dark mode)
