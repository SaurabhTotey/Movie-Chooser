## TODO

- Stats page
- Ensure users can be deleted even if they are originators of movies
- On party page, move checkboxes to the left of names for easier lining up, and perhaps even alternate colors in user selection box
- Ensure handling of IDs of 0 is consistent for both users and movies
- Allow names to be changed and change the name of the Form component to something like AccountForm
- Documentation of EVERYTHING
- This README
- License
- Styling -- especially a better look for watching movies at night (so basically a dark mode)
