## Workflow

## TODO

- Home page
- WatchedEntry should specify from whose list the entry came from -- this is difficult because the party page will need to accomodate that as will the form on the add-movie page
- Stats page
- This README
- License
- Styling -- especially a better look for watching movies at night (so basically a dark mode)
