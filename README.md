## TODO

- Stats page
- Ensure users can be deleted even if they are originators of movies
- Ensure handling of IDs of 0 is consistent for both users and movies
- Allow names to be changed and change the name of the Form component to something like AccountForm
- Documentation of EVERYTHING
- This README
- License
- Look at calls of MovieApiManager's getMovieInformationFor and try and reduce the number of calls (e.g. aggregate IDs first and then make calls and don't make repeated calls for the same ID)
- Styling -- especially a better look for watching movies at night (so basically a dark mode)
